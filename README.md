# short-js

Simple and shorter explanation for web front-end concepts.

### Why?

Had the basic meaning of terminologies been clear, Front-end development would have been a different world and also the Functional programming would not be so mystical and mythical.

This is an attempt in a direction to help clear clouds of confusion and dilemna.

It is not a book. It is not a guide. It is more like a refresher and pointer to refine your understanding. We have seen people stumble during interviews and technical discussions. For example, most of the people we interviewed failed to explain simple difference between parameters of a function and arguments to a function. And when confronted with modern functional JavaScript toolkits, this blurry boundaries got compounded.
