# short-js

Simple one-liner explanation for web front-end concepts.

# Why?

It is not a book. It is not a guide. It is more like a refresher and pointer to refine your understanding. We have seen people stumble when they appear for interview \(especially telephonic\) or any sort of technical discussion. Example, most of the people we interviewed failed to explain us simple difference between parameters of function and arguments to function. And when confronted with modern functional JavaScript toolkits, this blurry boundaries compounded the problem functions.

Had the basic meaning of terminologies been clear, Front-end development would have been a different world. Functional programming would not be so mystical and mythical.

This catalog, book, or whatever you name it, is an attempt to in this direction to help clear clouds confusion and dilemna.
